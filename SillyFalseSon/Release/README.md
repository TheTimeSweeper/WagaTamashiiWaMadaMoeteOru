Sorry, I'm the hitbox guy. His hitbox was ok, just could be bigger, but the swing effects were so egregiously large that they made you think things were gonna get hit that were not even close to the hitbox. also yeah just thought he should be bigger. you can make him any size for fun lol. idk this is my laziest readme, reach out to me (`thetimesweeper`) on the ror2 modding discord or the enforcer discord (https://discord.gg/r5XTMFd4W7) if ye want


### Size
sorry I'm the hitbox guy:
- Made him 1.12x bigger (configurable)
    - you can config this back to 1. he was plenty big
- Made his lobby size reflect his actual size (configurable)
    - the whole reason I made this mod is I saw in CSS he wasn't even bigger than loader. turns out he's over 2 commandos tall.
    - i've removed this discrepancy, and while I think he should be a bit taller in css, he doesn't need to be actual size. keeping it for the funny
- hibox size increased
    - Sorry, I'm the hitbox guy. His hitbox was ok, just could be bigger
    - The bigger problem was swing effects were so egregiously large that they made you think things were gonna get hit that were not even close to the hitbox
### Effects
- reduced the size and distance of M1 swing effects (not configurable sorry)
    - these now line up with the default hitbox
- increased the size of m1 + m2 slam to match the hitbox
    - did you know it was this big
