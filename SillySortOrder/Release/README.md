# Sort those bois

No longer are we prey to the arbitrary whimsy of mod makers' choice of whatever-at-the-time.  

Ping me (`thetimesweeper`) on the ror2 modding discord or the enforcer discord (https://discord.gg/csaEQDnMH8) if you have any issues/feedback.  
or if you just want to send (or even recieve) some nice words of encouragement

## Options:

<ins>ForceModdedCharactersOut:</ins>
- Pulls out modded characters from the lineup and places them after ror1 and ror2 survivors
- Goku and Vegeta get outta here

<ins>MixRor1Survivors:</ins>
- On by default. Mixes in ror1 folks loosely based on their unlock condition
- When off, neatly separates and groups ror1 survivors right after Vanilla

<ins>NemesesSeparate:</ins>
- Place Nemesis survivors together at the end of the main block, instead of right next to their counterpart where they usually are

<ins>CustomOrder:</ins>
- Finally, place any character in any spot you want by specifying their desired sort position.
- See Print Sorting config for existing order to copy paste and change. 
- See the wiki tab on this thunderstore page for more info.

<ins>Variants:</ins>
- if you have the Survariants mod, you can set automatically set nemeses as variants of their counterparts
- Similar to CustomOrder, you can set any survivor as a variant of any other survivor. read config entry for more info
___
### Maybe Plans:
 - Option to order all survivors to ror1 order for fun.
 - Option to set a variant as *not* a variant
 - Option to order variants. right now they're just in the order that they were added I think
