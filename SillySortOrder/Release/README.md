# Sort those bois

No longer are we prey to the arbitrary whimsy of mod makers' choice of whatever-at-the-time.  

Ping me (`TheTimesweeper#5727`) on the ror2 modding discord or the enforcer discord (https://discord.gg/csaEQDnMH8) if you have any issues/feedback.  
or if you just want to send (or even recieve) some nice words of encouragement

*3 full row css coming soon, maybe*

<ins>ForceModdedCharactersOut:</ins>
- Pulls out modded characters from the lineup and places them after ror1 and ror2 survivors
- Goku and Vegeta get outta here

<ins>MixRor1Survivors:</ins>
- On by default. Mixes in ror1 folks loosely based on their unlock condition
- When off, neatly separates and groups ror1 survivors right after Captain

<ins>NemesesSeparate:</ins>
- Place Nemeses survivors together at the end of the block, instead of right next to their counterpart where they usually are

<ins>More coming soon:</ins>
___
### Plans:
 - Handle nemeses better, for when those two or three upcoming guys come out maybe
 - Option to order all survivors to ror1 order for fun.
 - Config to blacklist/whitelist modded characters from the force-out config 
 - Config to straight up place survivors in any spot you please.

Misc:
 - ~~Make an alternative or compat to/for ScrollableLobbyUI that keeps 8 surivors per row so you can get the satisfying-ass roster in these screenshots~~
