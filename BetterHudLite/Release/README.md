# BetterHudLite

Somewhat inspired by the BetterHud mod of old, by DekuDesu.

Ping me (`TheTimesweeper#5727`) on the ror2 modding discord or the enforcer discord (https://discord.gg/csaEQDnMH8) if you have any issues/feedback.  
I know there's gonna be a lot of issues lol

## Health Bar and Skills Moved to Center:
Config to disable either  
(or both, which would make the mod literally do nothing, like why, but you can)

*Health bar height and width customizable too!*

### Credits:
DestroyedClone - fixed skills panel
___
### Known Issues:
 - I've accounted for the ExtendedLoadout mod a bit but it's still kinda jankey
 - lot of cases untested. don't be shy letting me know
___
### Plans:
 - move level below health bar to give skills more room, 
   - and cause it's less important truthfully
   - this was unexpectedly annoying to do and make work with my health bar height config
 - Perhaps a little better compatibility with extendedloadout
   - or other mods with extra ui that I haven't tested at all like nemry or aatrox if that ever happens
 - This will never happen, hence naming this mod "lite" instead of "2": 
   - More of the crazy custom features that the old BetterHud mod had, namely moving/hiding the other ui elements
   - Would like the cool little skill cooldowns around the crosshair thingys, little prettier more readable less intrusive and such, 
     - would take a bit of work that I won't get around to but I'd love to see it
     - Played doom eternal recently and dang that shit's great

He'd put this in his readmes for his old mods so I'd like to do the same:
