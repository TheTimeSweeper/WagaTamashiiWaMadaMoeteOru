# Passed myself around like a 2 dollar slut I tell you what
I really liked to stick my hands everywhere.  
This modpack is invalid as it has dependencies on mods long deprecated lol. It's just a portfolio of stuff I worked on.

# My Work
the important stuff. see [my thunderstore page](https://thunderstore.io/package/TheTimesweeper/) for all my other mods.

Now includes Desolator, and Chrono Legionnaire, with more coming on the way because I can't help myself. | Initially made mostly for fun and for the halloween jam, Alien Hominid has since become officially part of the boys. polished, fleshed out, multiple weapons, have fun.  | In the future I'll have more to end on, and perhaps this will be more fleshed out as well, but he's a complete personal indulgence.                                          |

| The first of the boys, and my first experience modding with people. he's rad check it out. Course there's more I wanna do hopefully eventually.   | In order of when I worked on them, this is the second thing. Barely a change though just a network fix that took forver to merge in, and is now deprecated. | Still in 2021, I helped get Wyatt in the game with animations and such. Years later I ended up finishing and polishing Wyatt myself, so he is now one of the boys. | Third of the men. rob and I did the work unity-side to get him into the game, later I did a bunch again to help Moffein get him up to 1.0.                                          |

| I did a big sprucing up and polish on his gameplay ages ago, but Moffein really carried it to the finish line and beyond.                         | After rob left (the first time), I took up the task of fixing him, implementing all the new skins and maintaining. Animation rework has been *fun*.         | For the mod itself, just fixes and maintaining. On the tutorial, I have worked heavily, and continue to maintain and improve it.                                   | Still 2021. He gets here so early cause I did a baby tweak fix to drones floating. On the latest iteration, I handled all the models/skins/animations unity side.                   |

Think I helped with cadet's model maybe.                                                     | Happy to see a dota character, I stepped in and adjusted hitboxes and attack timings to feel real good. I still have the code maybe I could reupload lol |
